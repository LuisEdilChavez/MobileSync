This is an Android app that intelligently adapts its data syncing based on device context, such as signal strength, WiFi, battery level, and motion state. Unlike traditional sync tools, it adjusts sync frequency and behavior in real time to improve battery life, data consistency, and user experience. The app is built in Java with a clean Android Studio project structure and runs on devices with API 23+. Developers can extend it by adding new sensors or custom sync actions.
